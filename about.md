I am a Boston based Full-Stack Software Engineer. My specialties include Groovy, Grails, Java, and Oracle. I am a voracious learner and excellent problem solver.

In my freetime I watch and play a lot of soccer. I also enjoy a good run or gym session. I am an adventurous eater and beer drinker. And last but not least, I am an Eph!
