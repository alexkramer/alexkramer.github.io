I am a Boston based Full-Stack Software Engineer. I attended Williams College where I studied Computer Science and Physics. My specialties include Groovy, Grails, Java, and Oracle. I am a voracious learner and excellent problem solver. I enjoy performance tuning applications as well as designing solutions that make my users more efficient. I am constantly asking -- is there a better way?

In my freetime I watch and play a lot of soccer. I also enjoy a good run or gym session. I am an adventurous eater and beer drinker. Go ephs!
